# Github steps 

## Set up repo

Create a local folder and add the code and other files that you would like to share with your team. Setting up the repo might look like this:

````
cd /your-project-folder
echo "This is my readme text" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/abrennec/cc2_snake_game_dev.git
git push -u origin main
`````

Share the repo with your team, i.e., add collaborators.
